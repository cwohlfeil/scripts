The Actual Module
------------------
Location	./sample/ or ./sample.py
Purpose	- The code of interest
Your module package is the core focus of the repository. It should not be tucked away:

./sample/
If your module consists of only a single file, you can place it directly in the root of your repository:

./sample.py
Your library does not belong in an ambiguous src or python subdirectory.


License
--------
Location	./LICENSE
Purpose	- Lawyering up.
This is arguably the most important part of your repository, aside from the source code itself. The full license text and copyright claims should exist in this file.
If you aren’t sure which license you should use for your project, check out choosealicense.com.
Of course, you are also free to publish code without a license, but this would prevent many people from potentially using your code.


Setup.py
--------
Location	./setup.py
Purpose	- Package and distribution management.
If your module package is at the root of your repository, this should obviously be at the root as well.


Requirements File
-----------------
Location	./requirements.txt
Purpose	- Development dependencies.
A pip requirements file should be placed at the root of the repository. It should specify the dependencies required to contribute to the project: testing, building, and generating documentation.

If your project has no development dependencies, or you prefer development environment setup via setup.py, this file may be unnecessary.


Documentation
--------------
Location	./docs/
Purpose	- Package reference documentation.
There is little reason for this to exist elsewhere.


Test Suite
----------
Location	./test_sample.py or ./tests
Purpose	Package integration and unit tests.
Starting out, a small test suite will often exist in a single file:
./test_sample.py

Once a test suite grows, you can move your tests to a directory, like so:
tests/test_basic.py
tests/test_advanced.py

Obviously, these test modules must import your packaged module to test it. You can do this a few ways:
Expect the package to be installed in site-packages.
Use a simple (but explicit) path modification to resolve the package properly.
I highly recommend the latter. Requiring a developer to run setup.py develop to test an actively changing codebase also requires them to have an isolated environment setup for each instance of the codebase.

To give the individual tests import context, create a tests/context.py file:
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))

import sample

Then, within the individual test modules, import the module like so:
from .context import sample
This will always work as expected, regardless of installation method.

Some people will assert that you should distribute your tests within your module itself – I disagree. It often increases complexity for your users; many test suites often require additional dependencies and runtime contexts.


Makefile
---------
Location	./Makefile
Purpose	- Generic management tasks.
If you look at most of my projects or any Pocoo project, you’ll notice a Makefile laying around. Why? These projects aren’t written in C... In short, make is a incredibly useful tool for defining generic tasks for your project.

Sample Makefile:
init:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

test:
    py.test tests

.PHONY: init test
Other generic management scripts (e.g. manage.py or fabfile.py) belong at the root of the repository as well.


Imports
--------
Very bad
from modu import *
x = sqrt(4)  # Is sqrt part of modu? A builtin? Defined above?

Better
from modu import sqrt
x = sqrt(4)  # sqrt may be part of modu, if not redefined in between

Best
import modu
x = modu.sqrt(4)  # sqrt is visibly part of modu's namespace
